Description: Reddit is an online bulletin board and a social networking website
    where registered users can submit and discuss content. This package uses
    Reddit API to extract Reddit data using Reddit API. Note that due to the API
    limitations, the number of comments that can extracted is limited to 500 per
    thread. The package consists of 4 functions, one for extracting relevant URLs,
    one for extracting features out of given URLs, one that does both together and
    one that constructs graphs based on the structure of a thread.
