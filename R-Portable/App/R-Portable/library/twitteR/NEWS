CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.8 (2014-12-31)
-----------------------

USER VISIBLE CHANGES
     o The use of ROAuth and RCurl has been removed in favor of the httr
     package. This changes how OAuth authentication is handled, with the
     new system going through setup_twitter_oauth() and load_twitter_oauth().

     o Changed from using int64 to bit64 for large integer support
 
     o setup_twitter_oauth() will report if an authentication attempt fails

BUG FIXES
    o getCurRateLimitInfo now requires at least one supported resource family

NEW FEATURES
    o Added lookup_statuses, which will retrieve a vector of tweet IDs

    o Added resultType to searchTwitter, provided by Ajay Gopal

    o Added maxID to searchTwitter, provided by Paul Nulty

    o updateStatus now has an argument 'mediaPath' which can be used to 
    upload images. Provided by Christopher Hackett.

    o Added a DB persistence layer, with store_tweets_db/load_tweets_db and 
    store_users_db/load_users_db. 
   
    o Added a convenience method search_twitter_and_store() which can be used
    to periodically update a database table with search results. 

    o Added a function strip_retweets which will attempt to remove retweets
    from a list of Status objects.

    o Added a function 'retweeters' and a convenience method 'getRetweeters'
    to the Status class. This function takes an ID of a tweet and a count
    (default is 20) and will return the IDs of users who have retweeted this
    tweet. The getRetweeters convenience method only takes the count.

    o Added argument forceUtf8Conversion (accessible via ... in all exposed
    functionality) which if set to FALSE (default is TRUE) will disable the
    forced conversion to UTF-8. Note that doing this can cause bad behavior
    if responses pass on characters outside of UTF-8.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.7 (2013-7-8)
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o Added a 'urls' slot to the Status class. This is a data.frame containing
    information about any t.co shortened URLs, providing the expanded URL,
    a display string and the character positions the URL was extracted from.
    This only applies to t.co shortened URLs.

    o Added a function decode_short_urls as a utility to help users process
    shortened URLs which were not t.co shortened.

    o Included patch to force all characters to UTF-8 before passing along
    to rjson

    o Added function "favorites" which takes a user and returns a list of
    their n most recent favorited tweets. Also added convenience method
    to the user class getFavorites()    

    o Added favoriteCount field to the status class, i.e. x$getFavoriteCount()

    o Added isRetweet field to the status class, i.e. x$getIsRetweet()

    o Added retweets function to get retweets of a status, and a 
    $getRetweets() convenience method to the status class.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug where userTimeline would fail if given a single user
    object (as opposed to simple screen names, IDs, etc)

    o Fixed a bug in lookupUsers - if the user arg was NULL an error would
    be thrown. Now returns empty list

    o Fixed a bug in the assignment of latitude/longitude for tweets, these
    will now be properly populated
    
    o users$toDataFrame will now honor the stringsAsFactors argument

    o getFavoritesCount() will now work properly on users.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.6 (2013-04-05)
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug in searchTwitter which would fill the tail end of a query
    with duplicated tweets if the user requested more than available
    
    o Changed showStatus to use character based input due to large IDs

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.5 (2013-03-26)
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    - Changed 'blockOnRateLimit' (boolean) to 'retryOnRateLimit' (integer). If
     this value is supplied (to any of the twitteR API wrappers) the system
     will retry up to N times if Twitter's rate limit in effect. If the 
     retry limit is reached (even if it was 0) twitteR will now try to return
     any partial results that had been accumulated prior to the rate limit
     (with a warning)
   - Added function getTwitterOAuth(consumer_key, consumer_secret) which is a 
     wrapper around the ROAuth creation/handshaking process which embeds the
     Twitter URLs. Will also call registerTwitterOAuth for you and then return
     the OAuth credential so you can save it for future use if you wish.
